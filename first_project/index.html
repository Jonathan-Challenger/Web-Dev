            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Jonathan and I love to code. My background is in Psychology and Neuroscience and my passions include data analysis <br> and coding.
                I first started coding in 2020 during my Masters degree in Neuroscience. This is where I was introduced to MATLAB and R. <br>
                Since then I have been teaching myself Python, Java and SQL and now I am starting to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goals are to keep expanding my knowledge as much as can in a variety of different areas such as data analysis, front-end and  <br> 
                back-end development. This will help me to grow as a person and to increase my versitility. I am always hungry and determined <br>
                to learn more and to continue bettering myself. My aspiration is to have a career which involes coding and data analysis.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of my hobbies include:

            <h1>ATM application in Java</h1>
            <p>
                The aim of this project was to create a functioning ATM like app using swing which is a GUI toolkit for Java. This helped me to <br> develop my skills in Java 
                specifically relating to creating apps using a GUI and to develop my OOP skills. <br> The source code for this project can be found
