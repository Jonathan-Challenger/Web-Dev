            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Jonathan and I love to code. My background is in Psychology and Neuroscience and my passions include data analysis <br> and coding.
                I first started coding in 2020 during my Masters degree in Neuroscience. This is where I was introduced to MATLAB and R. <br>
                Since then I have been teaching myself Python, Java and SQL and now I am starting to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goals are to keep expanding my knowledge as much as can in a variety of different areas such as data analysis, front-end and  <br> 
                back-end development. This will help me to grow as a person and to increase my versitility. I am always hungry and determined <br>
                to learn more and to continue bettering myself. My aspiration is to have a career which involes coding and data analysis.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of my hobbies include:

            <h1>ATM application in Java</h1>
            <p>
                The aim of this project was to create a functioning ATM like app using swing which is a GUI toolkit for Java. This helped me to <br> develop my skills in Java 
                specifically relating to creating apps using a GUI and to develop my OOP skills. <br> The source code for this project can be found 
                <a href="https://github.com/Jonathan-Challenger/Java_projects/tree/main/ATM_project" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <p>
                        My focus in this project was to try to make something functional. A program that would actually work
                        in the way any login system does.
                    </p>

                        Therefore, if someone tries to login and they have not yet created an account they will be denied.
                        They must register an account before entering the menu.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Once the user has created an account and logged in they have access to the main menu.
                        From here they have multiple options depending on their goals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Java program was connected to a SQL database where all of the relative information was stored.
                        This database was used to verify the indentity of the users.

                        While using the ATM program you can add new accounts to this database and you can
                        manipulate the balance by using the deposit or the withdraw areas of the program.
